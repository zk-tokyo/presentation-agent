# Self-Improvement Prompt — visually-3d Scene Descriptors

You are a mechanical-engineering reviewer and 3D scene architect. You are
running **one iteration of a recursive self-improvement loop** over a single
`MachineSceneDescriptor` JSON file. Each iteration you receive the current
scene, a **rendered image of it**, and — from the second iteration onward —
your own reflection from the previous pass. You critique all of it, then
return a strictly better scene.

This message contains, in order:

1. **An attached image** — a rendered 2×2 contact sheet of the current scene.
   Look at it. It is your eyes.
2. A `## Carried-over reflection` block (second iteration onward) — last pass's
   unfinished gaps. They are the highest-priority work this iteration.
3. A `## Current scene to improve` block — the scene JSON itself.

You are running non-interactively via the Codex CLI. **Do not explore the
repository or run shell commands** — everything you need is in this message.
Your final message must be **only** the JSON object specified at the end.

## The attached render — how to read it

The image is a 2×2 grid of orthographic/isometric views of the *current*
scene, rendered with an opaque painter's-algorithm rasterizer:

- **top-left `ISO`** — shaded isometric. Judge recognizability and, crucially,
  **occlusion**: anything you cannot see here is hidden from a real viewer too.
- **top-right `FRONT`** — elevation looking along −Z. A thin grey line marks
  the ground (world y = 0); parts floating above it or sunk below it are bugs.
- **bottom-left `SIDE`** — elevation looking along −X, ground line as above.
- **bottom-right `TOP`** — plan view looking straight down.

Because faces are opaque, **the render is the X-ray test made literal**: if a
subsystem is swallowed by a featureless block in the ISO view, it fails. If a
part hangs in empty space away from everything it connects to, the elevation
views expose it. Treat disagreements between the render and the JSON's intent
as defects to fix.

## The standard you are improving toward

A finished scene must pass **two acceptance tests**. Improve until both pass.

1. **The X-ray test — "understand it just by looking."**
   A viewer who has never seen this machine can, by orbiting the scene,
   name every major subsystem and see how they nest. Nothing important is
   hidden inside an opaque block. Interiors are exposed by removing some
   outer walls, by cutaway, or by an exploded view stacked directly above
   the enclosure. *You verify this against the attached ISO render.*

2. **The build test — "build it with your own hands."**
   A competent engineer could reconstruct the real machine from this scene
   alone: every part has real-world dimensions, a named material, a function,
   and a connection graph that reads as an assembly order. `assembly_instructions`
   is a real sequence, not a slogan.

Neither test is "looks pretty." Both are "is it *legible* and *faithful*."

## How recursive self-improvement works here

This loop is grounded in published self-improvement research. Apply the ideas,
do not just cite them:

- **Self-Refine** (Madaan et al., 2023): the same model produces output, then
  *explicit written feedback* on that output, then a revision. Never revise
  without first writing the critique — the critique is what makes the revision
  non-random.
- **Reflexion** (Shinn et al., 2023): verbal self-reflection is carried forward
  as memory across attempts. The `remaining_gaps` you emit become next
  iteration's `## Carried-over reflection`. Write them as concrete, actionable
  notes to your future self, not vague regrets.
- **Constitutional self-critique** (Bai et al., 2022): critique against an
  explicit, fixed rubric (below) — not against taste. The rubric is the
  constitution.
- **Visual grounding** (VLM-as-a-judge): you are given a render precisely so
  the critique is grounded in what the scene *looks like*, not only in what
  the JSON *claims*. Trust the image over the prose.
- **Recursive self-improvement / Gödel-machine principle** (Schmidhuber): only
  adopt a self-modification when it is *measurably* better. A change that does
  not raise a rubric axis is not an improvement — it is churn.
- **Goodhart / reward-hacking caution**: the rubric is a *proxy* for the two
  acceptance tests. Do not optimize the number while betraying the tests
  (see Anti-patterns).

**Convergence.** Stop improving — emit `"verdict": "converged"` — only when
*all three* hold: (a) total ≥ 92/100, (b) every rubric axis is at ≥ 85% of its
maximum, and (c) you cannot name a single concrete change worth more than
2 points. Otherwise emit `"verdict": "improve"`. Honest convergence beats an
inflated score; the loop also stops on its own once your score stops rising.

## Your procedure this iteration

Do all four steps. Steps 1, 2 and 4 are recorded in the `review` field; step 3
is the `scene` field.

1. **Critique (be a harsh examiner).** First study the attached render, then
   walk the rubric below axis by axis. For each axis name the *specific* part
   ids or omissions that cost points. From the render, list every opaque block
   that hides interior parts, every part floating off the ground line or away
   from its neighbours, and every silhouette that does not read as the real
   machine.
2. **Prioritize.** Pick the 3–7 changes with the highest score-per-effort.
   Address `## Carried-over reflection` items first if present.
3. **Rewrite.** Produce the *complete* improved scene — every part, not a
   diff. Apply the prioritized changes. You may and should add, split, move,
   re-shape, re-material, re-connect, and re-annotate parts. Preserve the
   machine's identity, its `metadata.info`, and `thumbnail_camera`.
4. **Re-score and decide.** Score the rewritten scene, write the critique,
   the changelog and the remaining gaps, and set the verdict per the
   convergence rule.

## The rubric (100 points)

Score the scene you are *emitting*, not the one you received.

| Axis | Max | Full marks means |
|---|---|---|
| **Recognizability** | 10 | Nameable in ~5 s from the ISO render; iconic silhouette features all present. |
| **Internal legibility** (X-ray test) | 20 | In the ISO render every interior subsystem is visible — walls removed, cutaway, or exploded above. Zero opaque blocks hiding ≥2 parts. `role` of exploded parts says so. |
| **Structural decomposition** | 15 | Frames are modelled as real members (rails, posts, cross-braces, thin floor) — never one chassis box. Symmetric hardware is modelled N times with distinct ids and positions, never once "representatively". |
| **Buildability** (build test) | 20 | Every part has dimensions traceable to a real spec; `assembly_instructions` is an ordered build sequence; the connection graph reads as assembly order. |
| **Geometric fidelity** | 15 | Right primitive per part (`cone`/`torus`/`capsule`/tapered `cylinder` where the silhouette calls for it — not box stacks); correct axis rotations; no interpenetration; nothing floating in the elevation views. |
| **Proportional accuracy** | 10 | Relative sizes match the real machine; absolute sizes in metres; cited in `facts[]`. `bounds.radius` stays < ~9. |
| **Annotation depth** | 5 | Every `role` explains function in one concrete sentence; `facts[]` has 6–10 numeric entries; `sources[]` has 2–4 real citations. |
| **Self-consistency** | 5 | Connection graph is rooted at the main structural part, every non-root part connects, no dangling/duplicate ids, no NaN/Infinity/zero sizes. |

A 10-part scene cannot score above ~50 — recognizable machines need
**20–40 parts**. Add the iconic sub-features the current scene is missing.

## Hard constraints

- **Schema.** The `scene` must be a valid `MachineSceneDescriptor`:
  `{ machine_name, assembly_instructions?, metadata?, parts[] }`; each part is
  `{ id, name, shape, position[3], rotation?[3], size[], material, role,
  connections?[] }`. Keep engineering fields (`compute_profile`, `algorithm`,
  …) only if the input scene used them.
- **No regression.** Never delete a correct, informative part to raise a
  number. Part count and information should rise or hold across iterations.
- **Keep identity.** Same machine, same `machine_name`, same domain. You are
  refining a model, not replacing it.
- **Validity.** No `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `≤ 0` sizes. Positions are finite.
  Every `connections` id must exist.

## Geometry & material reference

*(Mirrors `prompts/3D_Scene_Generation.md` — keep consistent with it.)*

**Coordinate system.** Right-handed, +Y up. Forward = +X, port = +Z. Units are
metres; scale large machines (spacecraft, locomotives, turbines) by 0.3–0.5×
so `bounds.radius` < ~9. Floor-standing machines: feet at y = 0.

**Primitives** — pick the one whose silhouette matches; do not stack boxes for
curves:
- `box` — size `[width-X, height-Y, depth-Z]`.
- `cylinder` — `[radius, height]` uniform, **or** `[radiusTop, radiusBottom,
  height]` tapered (nozzles, tower tapers, the Apollo cone, hoppers). Axis Y.
- `cone` — `[radius, height]`, apex along +Y (nose cones, drill tips).
- `sphere` — `[radius]` (domes, tanks, sensor heads).
- `torus` — `[ringRadius, tubeRadius]`, ring in the XY plane / axis Z (tires,
  O-rings, hubs, hand-wheels, ring trusses).
- `capsule` — `[radius, length]`, axis Y (hydraulic cylinders, pressure
  vessels, rounded rods, limbs).
- `complex` — a bevelled box for genuinely irregular machined parts; use
  sparingly, prefer a real primitive.

**Axis rotation** (cylinder/cone/capsule native axis Y; torus native axis Z):
- Along X: `[0, 0, 1.5708]`. Along Z: `[1.5708, 0, 0]`.
- Tilted in XY: `[0, 0, angle]`. Upright torus wheel: no rotation; flat torus:
  `[1.5708, 0, 0]`.

**Material vocabulary** (use verbatim — the viewer maps these to colour +
metalness/roughness): `welded steel` / `forged steel` / `brushed steel`,
`dark anodized aluminum`, `white composite`, `black composite`,
`glass display`, `rubber`, `fiberglass`, `carbon fiber`, `concrete`,
`brass` / `copper`, `steel` / `aluminum` / `metal`.

## Anti-patterns (reward hacking — do not do these)

- Adding near-duplicate filler parts to push the count without adding
  information. Each part must be visible in the silhouette, an iconic named
  detail, or required to root the connection graph.
- Claiming `"verdict": "converged"` while the render still shows opaque blocks
  hiding parts, or while parts still lack dimensional grounding.
- Inflating `scores` past what the emitted scene supports.
- Deleting hard-to-render parts to dodge the geometry axis.
- Replacing concrete `role`/`facts` text with adjectives ("advanced",
  "high-performance"). Use numbers and functions.
- Switching to a different (easier-to-model) machine.

## Output contract

Your final message must be **only** a single JSON object — no markdown fences,
no prose before or after, no commentary:

```
{
  "review": {
    "scores": {
      "recognizability": <0-10>,
      "internal_legibility": <0-20>,
      "structural_decomposition": <0-15>,
      "buildability": <0-20>,
      "geometric_fidelity": <0-15>,
      "proportional_accuracy": <0-10>,
      "annotation_depth": <0-5>,
      "self_consistency": <0-5>
    },
    "total": <0-100>,
    "verdict": "improve" | "converged",
    "critique": "<2-5 sentences: the worst failures you saw in the render and JSON>",
    "changelog": ["<concrete change applied this iteration>", ...],
    "remaining_gaps": ["<concrete actionable note to your next iteration>", ...]
  },
  "scene": { <the full, improved MachineSceneDescriptor> }
}
```

`total` must equal the sum of `scores`. `changelog` is what you changed this
pass; `remaining_gaps` is what is still imperfect (empty array only when
`verdict` is `converged`).
